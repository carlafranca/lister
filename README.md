### Based on the requirement

- Github API has a bit of a confusion with "stargazer_count" and "watchers" which both are displaying the same data. They're using the "subscribers_count" as watchers but it's not part of the "org-repos" endpoint.
- The new version (V4) comes with the GraphiQL, maybe it would be a better option to reduce the calls/payload.
- Also I Didn't have the time to finish styling the app, testing crossbrowser, work on accessibility and other improvements.
